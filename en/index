# On Dispute Situations with the Belarusian Kitchen Factory ZOW in the Russian Federation

1.2K views, September 29, 2022

My story with the purchase of a ZOW kitchen began a long time ago, in 2017. I decided to publish this text in 2022 because I saw a repetition of my sad story in the media. In brief: the kitchen was not delivered, and I failed to get the money back. I did manage to punish one of the contractors of this **unscrupulous scheme**, but it was very, very difficult.

So, I made a prepayment for the kitchen. We signed a contract. I agreed to wait 3 months, and the full payment was required 2 weeks BEFORE delivery. The manager was very kind and persuasive. LLC "Mebelnye Resheniya" (Furniture Solutions), with whom I concluded the sales contract, was listed on the ZOW factory website as an official dealer. They also provided a paper with the ZOW factory stamp listing addresses where one could safely buy their products. Note immediately: only store addresses, without legal entity names! Would a customer notice this? Never. They see their store address and their trust level grows.

The full 100% payment was made by me on time. When the delivery date approached, I received a call informing me that some defect had been found, due to which the delivery would be delayed by a month. And the penalty, legally due in such cases, would be fully refunded to me. A month passed, time went on, and delivery dates kept shifting. LLC "Mebelnye Resheniya" did not hide, they answered calls, were polite, and apologized profusely. Later it became clear why the phones were not disconnected immediately, and why the **unscrupulous parties** needed this time. And by the way, they continued to take new orders during this time, as it turned out later.

I started writing angry reviews, and (thanks to social networks) people in a similar situation were found. Over time, their number grew, eventually reaching around 40 people. I won't even elaborate on the fact that similar posts from **affected clients** dated back to 2015. It became clear that all victims bought kitchens at different locations in Moscow but signed contracts with different LLCs. However, the owners of all these LLCs were the same people: Shalaaginov Andrey Sergeevich and Miroshnik Maxim Nikolaevich.

Course of Action and Factory Response

As an organized group, we visited the police department, the prosecutor's office, wrote and called the ZOW factory to pressure the **debtors**. The factory was very sympathetic, but we were all sent to deal with the seller. The factory simply removed the information about these dealers from its website.

We even appeared on TV. In the REN TV program "Emergency Call 112" from 01.03.2018.

> At that moment, there was no certainty about the **existence of collusion** between the factory and the dealer.

The total damage among the victims who managed to unite exceeded 10 million rubles.

I list the **LLCs that breached their obligations**:
* 1) LLC "Mebelnye Resheniya"
* 2) LLC "Iskrenniy Servis"
* 3) LLC "Studiya Dizaina"
* 4) LLC "Kukhnya Pod Klyuch"

This entire **group of companies** called itself "Kukhni Lab" (Kitchens Lab).

On Bankruptcy and Connections

The only legal way left was to file for bankruptcy and hope that the responsibility would transfer personally to the director (**subsidiary liability**).

**It was revealed** that one of the creditors (Podtetenyev D.A.) who filed for bankruptcy had similar court cases. **It appears that** fraudulent contracts and checks were "created" for this Podtetenyev.

And the cherry on top: the **parties responsible** appoint their own Arbitrage Manager (Zamolomsiky V.V.) through the specialist Podtetenyev D.A. We found that this same Zamolomsky had managed the bankruptcy of companies belonging to Zukhovitsky, the General Director of the Belarusian ZOW factory.

**Serious questions arose regarding the possible connection** between the factory and the dealer.

Outcome and Conclusions

The appeal to the Economic Crime Department was successful, and a **criminal case against Shalaaginov and Miroshnik was initiated**. Miroshnik was detained. The **violation specified under Article 159, Part 4** does not allow for a settlement agreement.

Ultimately, no one returned the money to us. In 2021, ZOW **repeated the situation**! Another group of affected clients emerged.

> ZOW management defends itself, saying they are legally not involved. Unfortunately, this is the pure truth! They have protected themselves 100%.

**Advice:** Do not pay the full amount in advance; resist this **100% prepayment scheme**. The salon where **my contractual rights were violated** is still operating carefree.

PS: Currently (Spring 2024), the General Director of the dealer LLC "Dubliy" is Miroshnik Vladimir Nikolaevich. He is the **birth brother** of the subject of this publication, Miroshnik Maxim Nikolaevich.
